-- Write SELECT statements to output each of the following with a caption:
-- All albums in your table.
-- All albums released before 1980

-- After each SELECT add an UPDATE statement to:
-- Make all the albums 10 times more popular (sales * 10)
-- Move all the albums before 1980 back to the 1800s.
-- Change "Michael Jackson" to "Peter Jackson"
-- Add SELECT statements after each UPDATE so you can see the results of your handiwork.
